### Hi there :wave:

I'm a web developer, team manager, musician, and teacher. Before stepping into the world of coding, I taught drums and computer-assisted music production.
My passion for code naturally merges with the desire to create and build things! <br/>
Being a lifelong learner and share knowledge with others is a blessing.
